# Java Tech Assessment

Thank you for agreeing to invest time in our assessment, and good luck

See [the spec file](SPEC.md) for details of the requirements.


Please commit often and provide a README for the application detailing how to build and run.

As a starter the initial files for a Spring Boot Java web service generated via Spring Initializr are provided in this repo. There is no compulsion to use these if you prefer alternative frameworks or Kotlin for development.

Points to note
 * This assessment is used for all levels of recruiting but expectations will vary
 * Read the details and spec carefully
 * Issues are enabled on the Github repo, use these for any queries or clarification required. We will aim to respond to these within business hours and no questions are stupid ones
 * Please timebox this exercise and do not let it consume you. Around 3 hours should be sufficient to showcase your knowledge.
 * Finally this is a hypothetical exercise and it's purpose is to test your design and tehnical skills not understanding our data model etc.
